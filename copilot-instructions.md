## Best Practices

- Try to look out for best practices in code, documentation, testing, and project structure.
- If you see an opportunity to improve the project in any of these areas, take it!

## Security

- Peform security reviews for any code changes, especially those that handle authentication, secrets, or external communication.
- Follow secure coding practices and avoid hardcoding secrets or sensitive information in the codebase.
- Use environment variables or secure vaults for managing secrets and credentials.
- Scan code by using tools like `semgrep, codeql, bandit` to identify potential security issues before merging changes.
- Verify code based on OWASP top 10 security risks and ensure that the code does not introduce vulnerabilities such as injection, broken authentication, or sensitive data exposure.

## Testing

- Test first development approach must be followed for all code changes.
- Automated tests are required for any capability added or changed in this project.
- New functionality should include test coverage appropriate to the scope of the change.
- Regressions should be covered by automated tests when fixed.

## Documentation Sync

- Documentation in `documentation/` must be kept in sync with code and implementation.
- Any code or capability change that affects behavior, interfaces, or workflows must update the relevant documentation.

## Markdown Structure

- Any documentation markdown file must have a table of contents.
- The table of contents must be kept up to date with the document content.

# Implementation Instructions

- Use react for any UI component development.
- Use typescript for any code development.
- Use playwright for testing any UI components.
- Security best practices must be followed for any code development, especially for handling authentication, secrets, or external communication.
- Follow secure coding practices and avoid hardcoding secrets or sensitive information in the codebase.
- Use environment variables or secure vaults for managing secrets and credentials.
- Use dark schema for any UI component development.

## Documentation

## General

- Any documentation must have a table of contents.
- The table of contents must be kept up to date with the document content.
- Documentation should be clear, concise, and well-structured to facilitate understanding and navigation.
- Use consistent formatting and style across all documentation files.
- Use examples and diagrams where appropriate to illustrate concepts and workflows. (preferably using mermaid)
- Link to related documentation and resources to provide additional context and information.
- Avoid describing the same information redundantly across multiple documents; instead, link to a single source of truth when possible.
- For any code-related documentation, ensure that it is accurate and reflects the current state of the codebase.

### README.md

- File: /README.md
- Should provide a high-level overview of the project, including:
  - What the project is
  - Key features and capabilities
  - Quick start instructions
  - Links to detailed documentation

- Each major capability or tool should be briefly described in the README with links to the full documentation in `documentation/`.
- The README should be concise and focused on providing an introduction and navigation to the project.
- If possible show the core architecture of the component in graphical way by using mermaid diagrams.

### Implementation

- File: /documentation/implementation.md
- Should provide a detailed description of the implementation of the project, including:
  - Architecture overview (components, interactions, data flow)
  - Key components and their interactions
  - Data flow and processing
  - Any important design decisions or trade-offs made during development

### Installation

- File: /documentation/installatiion.md
- Should contain everything needed to get the project up and running, including:
  - Prerequisites
  - Setup steps
  - Claude Desktop configuration
  - MCP Inspector usage

### Dependencies

- File: /documentation/dependencies.md
- Should list all major dependencies and their purpose in the project.

### Tests

- File: tests.md
- Should list all tests in the project with:
  - What they test
  - Setup required
  - Assertions made

### Environment Variables

- File: /documentation/environment-variables.md
- Should contain all details for environment variables
- Each Environment Variable should be described by:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Possible values
  - Default value

### MCP Tool Documentation

- File Name: tools.md
- Tool documentation must contain a list of tools broken down by area.
- Tool documentation must use each tool as its own chapter or section.
- Each tool section must show:
  - description
  - input
    - schema: parameters with description, type, and whether required
    - example input
  - output
    - schema: parameters with description, type, and whether required
    - example input

## Change Discipline

- Any changes on documentation must remain consistent with these instructions.
- Any changes on code base (test, config, tests,..) must be synchronized with documentation.

## Jira Template Ticket Creation Workflow

- Tool selection is mandatory:
  - If the user asks to create a ticket "from template" or provides `template_issue_key` (for example `FLICA-122`), use `jira_create_ticket_from_template`.
  - Do not use `jira_create_issue` for template-based requests.

- For `jira_create_ticket_from_template`, if the tool returns `status=needs_placeholder_values`, always collect user input for each placeholder before retrying creation.
- Prompt the user once per placeholder, using the placeholder name in the question text (for example: `Provide a value for {integration}`).
- Do not skip placeholders and do not batch multiple placeholders into one free-text prompt.
- After collecting values for all required placeholders, call `jira_create_ticket_from_template` again with `placeholder_values` filled for every required placeholder.
- If the user leaves a required placeholder empty, ask again for that specific placeholder.
